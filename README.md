# SMS Spam Detection (Machine Learning Project)

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (legitimate)** using multiple supervised learning models.

The work was completed as part of an MSc Data Science coursework and focuses on **model comparison, evaluation, and reproducibility**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Unsolicited spam messages are a common issue in mobile communication.  
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can automatically detect spam SMS messages with high accuracy and reliability.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset  
- **Size:** 5,500+ SMS messages  
- **Classes:** Spam / Ham  

Text preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- TF-IDF vectorization

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented
The following models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Calibrated Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Each model was evaluated using standard classification metrics.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

Comparative performance analysis was conducted to identify the most effective classifier.
